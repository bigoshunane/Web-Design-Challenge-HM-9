# Web_Design_Challenge_HM9

The aim of this project is to create a visualization dashboard website by utilizing visualizations we have developed in past homework_6 where [weather data](https://github.com/bigoshunane/Python_API_Challenge_HM6/blob/main/output_data/cities.csv ) was used.

While developing this dashboard web, we will be creating individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. Moreover, there will be a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots and another page where we can view the data used to build them. Dataset was cleaned by using Python and transformed to HTML format.
