# Web_Design_Challenge_HM9

The aim of this project is to create a visualization dashboard website by utilizing visualizations we have developed in past homework_6 where [weather data](https://github.com/bigoshunane/Python_API_Challenge_HM6/blob/main/output_data/cities.csv ) was used.

While developing this dashboard web, we will be creating individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. Moreover, there will be a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots and another page where we can view the data used to build them. Dataset was cleaned by using Python and transformed to HTML format.

# Data
[Weather data](https://github.com/bigoshunane/Python_API_Challenge_HM6/blob/main/output_data/cities.csv)

# Tools used
Python (Jupyter notebook), HTML, CSS

# Visualization

The website consists of 7 pages total, as shown below;

. Landing page 

         which shows:

. Comparisons page 

         that:
                 
            . Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
            . Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
            . The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and one across on extra-small and small screens.

. 4 Visualization pages: 
                   
               each with:
                    
                  . A descriptive title and heading tag.
                  . The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
                  . A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

   . Data page:
       
            that;
                 
               . Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
               . The table must be a bootstrap table component.
               . The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML.
